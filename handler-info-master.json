Anything within curly braces {} will be replaced with the value of the entry attribute or task info value associated with that key. For example, the default format is 'CN={displayname},CN=Users,{base}'.  In this case {displayname} is replaced with the displayname attribute value and {base} is replaced with the value of the 'base' task info value.  A full list of available entry attributes is available above.  If you use organizational units they can be substituted into the distinguished name in this manner. \n\n\n#### Important Note\nThis handler has been tested on Task 4.0.6 and should preform as expected on all Task 4.x.x versions.

Also, if a Source Security Group Name and/or Source Security Group Owner ID are provided, the IP Protocol, From Port, To Port, and CIDR IP Address Range must be left blank. This handler returns no results, so if no errors are caught and raised the rule has been successfully applied. \nMore specific information about these parameters can be found in the Amazon EC2 Ruby documentation (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/EC2/Client.html#authorize_security_group_ingress-instance_method) and in the EC2 REST documentation (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group-ingress.html). \nThe Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs.

These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \n\nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \n\nThis handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base information to process.

The relationship is established by placing the Incident Number in the 'Incident Number' field on the 'HPD:Work Log' form. \n\nThe Include Review Request parameter invokes a method that builds and places a link in the Notes field on the Work Info entry.  When this link is clicked, the original service request submission is opened in the read-only Review Request mode. \n\nThe Include Question Answers parameter invokes a method which builds a question and answer pair display of the service request submittal. These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \n\nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \n\nThis handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base information to process. All data is passed into the handler as parameters. \n\n\n\nThe following data is used to create the 'HPD:Worklog' record: \n\n* Sets the 'Detailed Description' field to a concatenation of the following: \n\n  - The URL link to the Review Request view of the triggering Kinetic Request submission (if provided). \n\n  - The value of the \"Work Info Notes\" parameter. \n\n  - The formatted string of Question name to full answer pairs (if provided). \n\n* Sets the 'Incident Entry ID' field to the result of a lookup to the HPD:Help Desk form.  The lookup is done using the incident number parameter and the resulting entry's request id is used. \n\n* Attaches the files associated to the specified Attachment field menu label parameters to the specified fields: \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log01'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 1\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log02'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 2\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log03'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 3\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the specified values: \n\n  - 'Communication Source'     => \"Web\" \n\n  - 'z1D Previous Operation'   => \"SET\" \n\n  - 'Status'                   => \"Enabled\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Type'            => \"General Information\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n\n  - 'Incident Number'          => \"Incident Number\" \n\n  - 'Description'              => \"Work Info Summary\" \n\n  - 'Detailed Description'     => \"Work Info Notes\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Date'            => \"Work Info Submit Date\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Submitter'       => \"Submitter\" \n\n  - 'Secure Work Log'          => \"Locked\" \n\n  - 'View Access'              => \"View Access\" ",

These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \n\nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \n\nThe following data is used to create the 'WOI:WorkInfo' record: \n\n* Sets the 'Detailed Description' field to a concatenation of the following: \n\n  - The URL link to the Review Request view of the triggering Kinetic Request submission (if provided). \n\n  - The value of the \"Work Info Notes\" parameter. \n\n  - The formatted string of Question name to full answer pairs (if provided). \n\n* Sets the 'Work Order Entry ID' field to the result of a lookup to the WOI:WorkOrder form.  The lookup is done using the work order id parameter and the resulting entry's request id is used. \n\n* Attaches the files associated to the specified Attachment field menu label parameters to the specified fields: \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log01'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 1\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log02'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 2\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log03'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 3\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the specified values: \n\n  - 'Secure Work Log'          => \"No\" \n\n  - 'View Access'              => \"Internal\" \n\n  - 'Communication Source'     => \"Web\" \n\n  - 'z1D Previous Operation'   => \"SET\" \n\n  - 'Status'                   => \"Enabled\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Type'            => \"General Information\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n\n  - 'Work Order ID'\t\t       => \"Work Order ID\" \n\n  - 'Description'              => \"Work Info Summary\" \n\n  - 'Detailed Description'     => \"Work Info Notes\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Date'            => \"Work Info Submit Date\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Submitter'       => \"Submitter\" ",

This is accomplished by formatting the value as follows: ``` { ... \"My Currency Field\":{\"value\":100.0,\"currency\":\"USD\"}, ... } ``` The value portion must be parsed as a float. You can accomplish this as follows in the Field Values parameter: ``` <%= { 'Text Field 1' => 'ABCD-EFG', 'Text Field 2' => '123456', 'Currency Field 1' => {'value' => @inputs[\"Currency Input\"].to_f, 'currency' => 'USD' }, }.to_json %> ``` ",

When this link is clicked, the original service request submission is opened in the read-only Review Request mode. \nThe Include Question Answers parameter invokes a method which builds a question and answer pair display of the service request submittal. These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application.

This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \nThis handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base information to process.

          "detailedDescription": "Creates Work Info entries related to an Incident.  The relationship is established by placing the Incident Number in the 'Incident Number' field on the 'HPD:Work Log' form. \nThe Include Review Request parameter invokes a method that builds and places a link in the Notes field on the Work Info entry.  When this link is clicked, the original service request submission is opened in the read-only Review Request mode. \nThe Include Question Answers parameter invokes a method which builds a question and answer pair display of the service request submittal. These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \nThis handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base information to process. All data is passed into the handler as parameters. \n\nThe following data is used to create the 'HPD:Worklog' record: \n* Sets the 'Detailed Description' field to a concatenation of the following: \n  - The URL link to the Review Request view of the triggering Kinetic Request submission (if provided). \n  - The value of the \"Work Info Notes\" parameter. \n  - The formatted string of Question name to full answer pairs (if provided). \n* Sets the 'Incident Entry ID' field to the result of a lookup to the HPD:Help Desk form.  The lookup is done using the incident number parameter and the resulting entry's request id is used. \n* Attaches the files associated to the specified Attachment field menu label parameters to the specified fields: \n  - 'z2AF Work Log01'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 1\" \n  - 'z2AF Work Log02'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 2\" \n  - 'z2AF Work Log03'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 3\" \n* Sets the following field values to the specified values: \n  - 'Communication Source'     => \"Web\" \n  - 'z1D Previous Operation'   => \"SET\" \n  - 'Status'                   => \"Enabled\" \n  - 'Work Log Type'            => \"General Information\" \n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n  - 'Incident Number'          => \"Incident Number\" \n  - 'Description'              => \"Work Info Summary\" \n  - 'Detailed Description'     => \"Work Info Notes\" \n  - 'Work Log Date'            => \"Work Info Submit Date\" \n  - 'Work Log Submitter'       => \"Submitter\" \n  - 'Secure Work Log'          => \"Locked\" \n  - 'View Access'              => \"View Access\" ",

The relationship is established by placing the Work Order ID in the 'Work Order ID' field on the 'WOI:WorkInfo' form. \nThe Include Review Request parameter invokes a method that builds and places a link in the Notes field on the Work Info entry.  When this link is clicked, the original service request submission is opened in the read-only Review Request mode. \nThe Include Question Answers parameter invokes a method which builds a question and answer pair display of the service request submittal. These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \nThe following data is used to create the 'WOI:WorkInfo' record: \n* Sets the 'Detailed Description' field to a concatenation of the following: \n  - The URL link to the Review Request view of the triggering Kinetic Request submission (if provided). \n  - The value of the \"Work Info Notes\" parameter. \n  - The formatted string of Question name to full answer pairs (if provided). \n* Sets the 'Work Order Entry ID' field to the result of a lookup to the WOI:WorkOrder form.  The lookup is done using the work order id parameter and the resulting entry's request id is used. \n* Attaches the files associated to the specified Attachment field menu label parameters to the specified fields: \n  - 'z2AF Work Log01'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 1\" \n  - 'z2AF Work Log02'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 2\" \n  - 'z2AF Work Log03'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 3\" \n* Sets the following field values to the specified values: \n  - 'Secure Work Log'          => \"No\" \n  - 'View Access'              => \"Internal\" \n  - 'Communication Source'     => \"Web\" \n  - 'z1D Previous Operation'   => \"SET\" \n  - 'Status'                   => \"Enabled\" \n  - 'Work Log Type'            => \"General Information\" \n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n  - 'Work Order ID'\t\t       => \"Work Order ID\" \n  - 'Description'              => \"Work Info Summary\" \n  - 'Detailed Description'     => \"Work Info Notes\" \n  - 'Work Log Date'            => \"Work Info Submit Date\" \n  - 'Work Log Submitter'       => \"Submitter\" ",

The relationship is established by placing the Work Order ID in the 'Work Order ID' field on the 'WOI:WorkInfo' form. \nThe Include Review Request parameter invokes a method that builds and places a link in the Notes field on the Work Info entry.  When this link is clicked, the original service request submission is opened in the read-only Review Request mode. \nThe Include Question Answers parameter invokes a method which builds a question and answer pair display of the service request submittal. These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \nThe following data is used to create the 'WOI:WorkInfo' record: \n* Sets the 'Detailed Description' field to a concatenation of the following: \n  - The URL link to the Review Request view of the triggering Kinetic Request submission (if provided). \n  - The value of the \"Work Info Notes\" parameter. \n  - The formatted string of Question name to full answer pairs (if provided). \n* Sets the 'Work Order Entry ID' field to the result of a lookup to the WOI:WorkOrder form.  The lookup is done using the work order id parameter and the resulting entry's request id is used. \n* Attaches the files associated to the specified Attachment field menu label parameters to the specified fields: \n  - 'z2AF Work Log01'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 1\" \n  - 'z2AF Work Log02'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 2\" \n  - 'z2AF Work Log03'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 3\" \n* Sets the following field values to the specified values: \n  - 'Secure Work Log'          => \"No\" \n  - 'View Access'              => \"Internal\" \n  - 'Communication Source'     => \"Web\" \n  - 'z1D Previous Operation'   => \"SET\" \n  - 'Status'                   => \"Enabled\" \n  - 'Work Log Type'            => \"General Information\" \n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n  - 'Work Order ID'\t\t       => \"Work Order ID\" \n  - 'Description'              => \"Work Info Summary\" \n  - 'Detailed Description'     => \"Work Info Notes\" \n  - 'Work Log Date'            => \"Work Info Submit Date\" \n  - 'Work Log Submitter'       => \"Submitter\" ",

Before uploading this handler, make sure to include a chef repository containing a knife.rb file either in the resources directory of the handler file or somewhere else on the task engine server. Once the handler starts running, it begins by error checking the parameters based on what type of server the task engine is running on (windows or unix). \n\nOn Windows machine the process consists of: \n\n- Loading and accepting the EULA for PsExec.exe (which will be used to run knife as a background process) \n\nOn both Unix and Windows machines the process consists of: \n\n- Checking if a knife.rb file is accessible from the handler \n\n- Checking if ruby with the json gem are installed (json is automatically included in ruby 1.9 and later) \n\n- Checking if the task location provided in the info values contains a source with the name provided in the parameters \n\nIf none of these situations throw an error, the handler then moves onto calling a script that handles the actual knife bootstrap call. This script is passed a json string of all the parameters provided to the handler. After creating a file within the handler resources folder that will contain all of the logging information for the bootstrap call (each call will have a different file, with the form of bootstrap_run_[epoch timestamp].log). The actual knife call that will be made follows the form of: \n\nknife bootstrap [server name] -x [user config] -N \"[node name]\" -r \"[recipe]\" -c [knife.rb location] \n\nThe bootstrapping process can take a long time, so once the script is started, the handler ends and is put into a deferred state until the bootstrap command is complete. Once that finishes, the script sends the deferral token back to the task tree using the Kinetic Task API and net/http (example POST that the script uses is below). Once the deferral token is recieved, the handler completes its process. \n\nTask 3 Deferral Callback \n\nPOST [task_location]/rest/v1/Trigger/createDeferred action=Complete&token=[deferral token] \n\nTask 4 Deferral Callback \n\nPOST [task_location]/app/api/v1/complete-deferred-task/[source name] { \"token\" : [deferral token] } \n\n\n#### Info Values\nTwo info values need to be provided with Chef Node Bootstrap. [Knife Location] The path to the knife.rb file on the server. If an absolute path is not given, the handler assumes the file was placed in the resources directory. \n\nie. chef-repo/.chef/knife.rb means that the file is located at chef_node_bootstrap_v1/handler/resources/chef-repo/.chef/knife.rb [Task Location] The url where your task instance is located \n\nie. http://127.0.0.1:8080/kinetic-task \n\n\n#### Knife Configuration\nInformation on how to configure knife on your machine can be found at -- http://docs.getchef.com/chef/knife.html ",

Before using this handler, a valid Service Account must be created/used and the Google Sheets API needs to be enabled (see below for details on how to do this). Using the contents of a Google Service Account JSON key to authenticate against Google's API, the handler takes a spreadsheet id, worksheet name, and row number and removes the values from all the columns in that row. (If you don't already have the spreadsheet id, it can be found in the URL when editing a spreadsheet in the browser - between the /d/ and /edit.) \n\nie. For the url - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xyao84fV2LyU1svyx48KTSbBgiq_mPr2w142bbZce8g/edit#gid=0 \n\n- the id is: 1xyao84fV2LyU1svyx48KTSbBgiq_mPr2w142bbZce8g \n\n\n\n\n#### service_account_key_json Info Value\nTo authenticate with Google, the handler uses the contents to the Service Account JSON key to authenticate against Google. When the handler has been uploaded to Kinetic Task, open up the JSON key that was downloaded from Google (instructions below if needed) and copy the contents of it into the service_account_key_json info value (copy everything, including the beginning and ending JSON braces {}). \n\n\n#### Creating a Service Account\n\n  1. Navigate to the 'Google Developers Console' \n    - Located at https://console.developers.google.com \n    - If the URL has changed, try googling 'Google API Developer Console' to either find the console or find Google's current documentation for how to create an API project \n  2. Create a new API Project \n    - If you have an existing project, navigate to that project page if you aren't already there by default \n  3. Navigate to Credentials \n  4. Create a new Credential of the type 'Service Account' \n    - When creating the Service Account, choose a 'Key type' of JSON \n  5. Make note of where the JSON key was downloaded on creation. It will be needed for authentication later. \n\n\n#### Enabling the Google Sheets API\n\n  1. In the Google Developers Console, navigate to the Library section \n  2. Find the Google Sheets API and click on the link \n  3. Find 'Enable' at the top of the page and click it to enable the API \n\n\n#### Allowing an Impersonated User to Authenticate with the Service Account\nNOTE: To allow an impersonated user to authenticate with a service account, a process called 'Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority' must be enacted by a Google Apps account admin to allow a Service Account to impersonate users. \n\n  1. Go to your Google Apps domain’s Admin console. \n\n  2. Go to the 'Security' page. \n\n  3. Select 'Advanced settings' from the list of options. If it isn't on the page originally, click 'Show More' at the bottom of the page. \n\n  4. Select 'Manage API client access' in the Authentication section. \n\n  5. Using the Client Id associated with your service account, attach 'One or More API scopes' for the services that you want the Service Account to have access to. \n\n    - API Scope(s) needed for this handler: \n\n      - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive OR \n\n      - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets \n\n    - If you don't have a Client Id associated with your Service Account (should see it under 'OAuth 2.0 client IDs' on the Credentials page), see the section below for setting that up \n\n    - If they aren't explicity added in every time the scope list is updated, any scopes that have been previously setup will be removed. \n\n      - If you have a Client Id that already has domain wide calendar scope, to add the spreadsheets scope without losing the Calendar scope you need to add the Calendar scope to the comma separated list of scopes to add \n\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar CHANGES TO \n\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar \n\n\n#### Creating a Client ID for a Service Account\n\n  1. In the Google Developers Console, navigate to the Credentials section \n  2. Navigate to Manage Service Accounts \n  3. Edit the Service Account you want to give a Client ID to \n  4. Select 'Enable G Suite Domain-Wide Delegation' \n  5. Back on the Credentials page, the Service Account will now be associated with a Client ID ",

          "detailedDescription": "This handler uses the Google Admin SDK API library to suspend a previously created Google Account on your domain. As long as the inputted username is in the database, it will be suspended. If an account is already suspended, this call will just pass through and the account in question will continue to be suspended. Any errors that occur during the posting process will be caught and re-raised by this handler. \n\n* In order to use this handler, the account specified by the task info values needs to enable Admin SDK API in admin account. \n\n#### How to retrieve the Service Account Email and Setup P12 File\nTo enable the Calendar API and get the Service Account Email and P12 File \n    1. Navigate to the 'Google Developers Console' \n    2. Click on the Create Project button (or if you have an existing project that you wish to keep using, click on the project name.) \n    3. Go to the APIs page and turn on the Calendar service \n    4. Go to the Credentials page and Create a new Client Id \n        * Select 'Service Account' \n        * Select 'P12 Key' for Key type \n    5. When you click 'Create Client Id', a P12 File will be downloaded \n    6. Remember the Email for the Service Account that you just created \nTo add the P12 file to the handler: \n    1. Download the .zip file for the handler \n    2. Expand the zipped directory, and place the P12 File that you just downloaded into the resources folder \n        * Found at google_apps_calendar_create_v3 => handler => resources \n        * Remember the name of the P12 File, it will be needed later \n    3. Zip the directory back up and upload to Kinetic Task \nThe Service Account Email and P12 File name will be used as info values for the handler, and will be used to get access to the Google Services \n\n#### How to Perform Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority to Allow Impersonation\n  1. Go to your Google Apps domain’s Admin console. \n  2. Select Security from the list of controls. If you don't see Security listed, select More controls from the gray bar at the bottom of the page, then select Security from the list of controls. \n  3. Select Advanced settings from the list of options. \n  4. Select Manage third party OAuth Client access in the Authentication section. \n  5. In the Client name field enter the service account's Client ID. \n  6. In the One or More API Scopes field enter the list of scopes that your application should be granted access to (see image below). For example if you need domain-wide access to the Google Directory API enter: \n     * https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group \n  7. Click the Authorize button. ",

As long as the user has sufficient privileges, the first call to SharePoint returns a hash containing all of the Site lists and their details. The handler then uses that list to get the correct list id that corresponds with the list title given during input and then makes another SOAP call to get the the list contents which are returned in a hash. The handler then takes that response, cleans up the hash, and then converts it to a JSON table to allow for easy access of the information.

          "detailedDescription": "This handler leverages Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) technology to execute SQL queries against a database server.  JDBC provides an abstract inferface for querying against different database systems.  In order to configure a connection, a JDBC Driver must be made available, typically by including a .jar file somewhere on the classpath.  In order to initializing the JDBC connection, a JDBC driver, or adapter class, associated to the connection must be pre-loaded.  Once the JDBC adapter class is loaded, a simple connection string, which specifies the location of the server, name of the database to connect to and a list of parameters can be used to initialize a connection. \nPractically, this means that a JDBC .jar file specific to the target database server will need to be added to the Kinetic Task web application WEB-INF/lib directory.  Additionally, the adapter class and connection string info values will need to be configured specific to the JDBC adapter that is being used to connect.  Below are some example configurations for commonly used JDBC adapters. \nDB2 Adapter Class:     com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver Connection String: jdbc:db2://[SERVER][:PORT]/[DATABASE] \nMicrosoft SQL Server Adapter Class:     com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver Connection String: jdbc:sqlserver://[SERVER][:PORT];databaseName=[DATABASE] \nOracle Adapter Class:     oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver Connection String: jdbc:oracle:thin:@//[SERVER][:PORT]/[SERVICENAME] \nMySQL Adapter Class:     com.mysql.jdbc.Driver Connection String: jdbc:mysql://[SERVER][:PORT]/[DATABASE] \nOnce you have JDBC configured, you will also need to configure the handler to execute your specific query. In the node.xml file, insert your query in the <config name=\"query\"/> node, using curly braces for the parameters that you wish to be dynamic. Below is an example of a query were the username and name will be dynamic values. \nSELECT * FROM Users WHERE name={name} AND username={username} \nAny value that you used inside of the curly braces will now need to be added as a parameter. The parameter id must be the same as the value in the curly braces for the query to properly execute. Once all this is configured, the handler will now be able to retrieve a value for you from your desired database! \n\n\n#### Testing the Handler\nNOTE: Testing this handler requires the Kinetic Task 3.0 testing harness. \nIn order to test this handler, the JDBC .jar file must be made available to the java virtual machine.  In order to do this, java must be called directly (rather than executing the kinetic task jar file using java -jar kinetic-task.jar ...).  See below for a sample execution (which assumes that the current working directory is the root of the handler): \njava -classpath [PATH]\\kinetic-task.jar;[PATH]\\[JDBC_JAR_FILE].jar com.kineticdata.task.Main -test-handler=. \nThe simple test case shows the configuration for executing this handler against a Kinetic Matrix instance, which uses an Oracle database.  Included in the test directory is a lib/ojdbc6.jar file, which is a JDBC jar file for Oracle (which requires Java 6 or higher).  If the test harness is being run from Java 6 and connecting to a Matrix instance, the following command line can be used to execute the test process: \njava -classpath [PATH]\\kinetic-task.jar;test\\lib\\ojdbc6.jar com.kineticdata.task.Main -test-handler=.

          "detailedDescription": "This handler leverages Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) technology to execute SQL queries against a database server.  JDBC provides an abstract inferface for querying against different database systems.  In order to configure a connection, a JDBC Driver must be made available, typically by including a .jar file somewhere on the classpath.  In order to initializing the JDBC connection, a JDBC driver, or adapter class, associated to the connection must be pre-loaded.  Once the JDBC adapter class is loaded, a simple connection string, which specifies the location of the server, name of the database to connect to and a list of parameters can be used to initialize a connection. \nPractically, this means that a JDBC .jar file specific to the target database server will need to be added to the Kinetic Task web application WEB-INF/lib directory.  Additionally, the adapter class and connection string info values will need to be configured specific to the JDBC adapter that is being used to connect.  Below are some example configurations for commonly used JDBC adapters. \nDB2 Adapter Class:     com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver Connection String: jdbc:db2://[SERVER][:PORT]/[DATABASE] \nMicrosoft SQL Server Adapter Class:     com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver Connection String: jdbc:sqlserver://[SERVER][:PORT];databaseName=[DATABASE] \nOracle Adapter Class:     oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver Connection String: jdbc:oracle:thin:@//[SERVER][:PORT]/[SERVICENAME] \nMySQL Adapter Class:     com.mysql.jdbc.Driver Connection String: jdbc:mysql://[SERVER][:PORT]/[DATABASE] \nOnce you have JDBC configured, you will also need to configure the handler to execute your specific query. In the node.xml file, insert your query in the <config name=\"query\"/> node, using curly braces for the parameters that you wish to be dynamic. Below is an example of a query were the username and password will be dynamic values. \nINSERT INTO Users (Id,Name,Username,Password) VALUES ({id},{name},{username},{password}) \nAny value that you used inside of the curly braces will now need to be added as a parameter. The parameter id must be the same as the value in the curly braces. Later, when defining the parameters nodes that is inside the <handler> node (the second set of parameter nodes in node.xml) make sure that the type is equal to the Java class that cooresponds to the parameter type in the database (Integer, String, Date, and Timestamp are supported in this sample). If you want to add a type that is not supported in this sample, you just need to add the type to the logic in init.rb (currently found between lines 76-87). \nOnce all this is configured, the handler will now be able to insert a value for you to your desired database! \n\n\n#### Testing the Handler\nNOTE: Testing this handler requires the Kinetic Task 3.0 testing harness. \nIn order to test this handler, the JDBC .jar file must be made available to the java virtual machine.  In order to do this, java must be called directly (rather than executing the kinetic task jar file using java -jar kinetic-task.jar ...).  See below for a sample execution (which assumes that the current working directory is the root of the handler): \njava -classpath [PATH]\\kinetic-task.jar;[PATH]\\[JDBC_JAR_FILE].jar com.kineticdata.task.Main -test-handler=. \nThe simple test case shows the configuration for executing this handler against a Kinetic Matrix instance, which uses an Oracle database.  Included in the test directory is a lib/ojdbc6.jar file, which is a JDBC jar file for Oracle (which requires Java 6 or higher).  If the test harness is being run from Java 6 and connecting to a Matrix instance, the following command line can be used to execute the test process: \njava -classpath [PATH]\\kinetic-task.jar;test\\lib\\ojdbc6.jar com.kineticdata.task.Main -test-handler=.

          "detailedDescription": "This handler package includes a lib/helloworld.jar package.  This package includes a single Java class (for sample.helloworld.Greeter) that defines the static method \"greet\".  This method takes two java.util.LinkedHashMap parameters (one for the task handler info values and one for the passed parameters) and returns another java.util.LinkedHashMap. \nThe handler init.rb file defines the typical handler class (in this case SampleJavaHelloWorldV1) with an #initialize and #execute method.  The #initialize method builds up a java.util.LinkedHashMap for for the info values and parameters rather than a Ruby Hash so that they are easier to pass into the Java application.  The #execute method calls the desired Java class method, passing in the two java.util.LinkedHashMap objects, and then iterates over the returned java.util.LinkedHashMap object (representing a map of result names to values) to build up the typical XML result. \n\n#### Modifying This Handler\nTo modify this handler, the process/info.xml and process/node.xml files will need to be adjusted as normal (in order to define the handler node info configuration values, input parameters, and output results.  The only changes necessary to the handler/init.rb file are to change the class name and the Java code that is called (see below for the current Java code call). Java::sample.helloworld.Greeter.greet(@info_values, @parameters) \nThis particular handler includes the helloworld application as a .jar file included in the handler/lib directory.  Java applications that are compiled as jar files and included in the handler/lib directory need to be manually included in the handler/init.rb file (as helloworld.jar is for this sample package). This is only required for java libraries that have not already been loaded in the JVM classloader (usually by being placed somewhere on the classpath).  Any Java libraries or classes that were loaded by the JVM can be referenced without additional Ruby require statements. \nIf there are multiple handlers that are using the same library jar files, it is typically preferred to put those jar files somewhere on the JVM classpath (in the case of Tomcat, %WEBAPP_HOME%/WEB-INF/lib and omitting the manual include call in the handler/init.rb file.  Please remember that any changes to the jar file will require a restart of the JVM (or web application server) to be picked up. ",

The return json uses the sys_id as the key and the value is another JSON map with all the information about the incident. To query for an incident, you need to provide the query in xml. The handler uses the getRecords call from the Service Now SOAP API, so the parameter provided just needs to specify what to look for in incident fields. For example, if you are searching for a date (or anything that can't be qualified by a direct equality statement), you can use the <__encoded_query> parameter, which can be used for any general query statements. For example, you could search for any incidents that were created after a certain time (ie. <__encoded_query>sys_created_on > 2014-04-15</__encoded_query>). For everything else, you can make the search with the xml tag beings the field that you want to search. For example, if you want to match a incident number or short description, you would search for <number>INC000000001</number> or <short_description>this is a short description</short_description>. ",
