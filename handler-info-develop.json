This causes Remedy workflow to map values from the template into the CHG:Infrastructure Change (Changes) form. \n\nAdditional information about the usage of Infrastructure Change Templates can be found in the BMC Remedy ITSM Configurations guide. \n\nThe following data is used to create the 'CHG:ChangeInterface_Create' record: \n\n* Sets the 'TemplateID' field to the Instance Id of the Change template that was specified in the \"Change Template Name\" parameter. \n\n* Maps the deferral token of the task instance generated by this handler into the 'SRMSAOIGuid' field. \n\n\n\n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n\n  - 'First Name'            => \"Requester First Name\" \n\n  - 'Last Name'             => \"Requester Last Name\" \n\n  - 'Customer Internet E-mail' => \"Requester Email\" \n\n  - 'Company'               => \"Requester Support Company\" \n\n  - 'Submitter'             => \"Submitter Login Id\" \n\n  - 'Company3'              => \"Change Manager Support Company\" \n\n  - 'Support Organization'  => \"Change Manager Support Organization\" \n\n  - 'Support Group Name'    => \"Change Manager Support Group Name\" \n\n  - 'SRID'                  => 'CustomerSurveyID' (the KSR number) \n\n  - 'SRInstanceID'          => 'CustomerSurveyInstanceId' (the Instance Id).

          "detailedDescription": "Creates Work Info entries related to a Change Request.  The relationship is established by placing the Change Number in the Infrastructure Change ID field on the CHG:Work Log form. \n\nThe Include Review Request parameter invokes a method that builds and places a link in the Notes field on the Work Info entry.  When this link is clicked, the original service request submission is opened in the read-only Review Request mode. \n\nThe Include Question Answers parameter invokes a method which builds a question and answer pair display of the service request submittal. These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \n\nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \n\nThis handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base information to process. All data is passed into the handler as parameters. \n\nThis handler allows for a configuration where the ARS system used for Kinetic and the ARS system used for BMC Remedy ITSM7 are different. \n\nThe following data is used to create the 'CHG:Worklog' record: \n\n* Sets the 'Detailed Description' field to a concatenation of the following: \n\n  - The URL link to the Review Request view of the triggering Kinetic Request submission (if provided). \n\n  - The value of the \"Work Info Notes\" parameter. \n\n  - The formatted string of Question name to full answer pairs (if provided). \n\n* Sets the 'Infra. Change Entry ID' field to the result of a lookup to the CHG:Infrastructure Change form.  The lookup is done using the change number parameter and the resulting entry's request id is used. \n\n* Attaches the files associated to the specified Attachment field menu label parameters to the specified fields: \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log01'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 1\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log02'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 2\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log03'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 3\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the specified values: \n\n  - 'Communication Source'     => \"Web\" \n\n  - 'z1D Previous Operation'   => \"SET\" \n\n  - 'Status'                   => \"Enabled\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Type'            => \"General Information\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n\n  - 'Infra. Change Entry ID'   => \"Change Number\" \n\n  - 'Infrastructure Change ID' => \"Change Number\" \n\n  - 'Description'              => \"Work Info Summary\" \n\n  - 'Detailed Description'     => \"Work Info Notes\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Date'            => \"Work Info Submit Date\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Submitter'       => \"Submitter\" \n\n  - 'Secure Work Log'          => \"Locked\" \n\n  - 'View Access'              => \"View Access\" ",

The relationship is established by placing the Change Number in the Infrastructure Change ID field on the CHG:Work Log form. \n\nThe Include Review Request parameter invokes a method that builds and places a link in the Notes field on the Work Info entry.  When this link is clicked, the original service request submission is opened in the read-only Review Request mode. \n\nThe Include Question Answers parameter invokes a method which builds a question and answer pair display of the service request submittal. These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \n\nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \n\nThis handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base information to process. All data is passed into the handler as parameters. \n\nThe following data is used to create the 'CHG:Worklog' record: \n\n* Sets the 'Detailed Description' field to a concatenation of the following: \n\n  - The URL link to the Review Request view of the triggering Kinetic Request submission (if provided). \n\n  - The value of the \"Work Info Notes\" parameter. \n\n  - The formatted string of Question name to full answer pairs (if provided). \n\n* Sets the 'Infra. Change Entry ID' field to the result of a lookup to the CHG:Infrastructure Change form.  The lookup is done using the change number parameter and the resulting entry's request id is used. \n\n* Attaches the files associated to the specified Attachment field menu label parameters to the specified fields: \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log01'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 1\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log02'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 2\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log03'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 3\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the specified values: \n\n  - 'Communication Source'     => \"Web\" \n\n  - 'z1D Previous Operation'   => \"SET\" \n\n  - 'Status'                   => \"Enabled\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Type'            => \"General Information\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n\n  - 'Infra.

The relationship is established by placing the Work Order ID in the 'Work Order ID' field on the 'WOI:WorkInfo' form. \n\nThe Include Review Request parameter invokes a method that builds and places a link in the Notes field on the Work Info entry.  When this link is clicked, the original service request submission is opened in the read-only Review Request mode. \n\nThe Include Question Answers parameter invokes a method which builds a question and answer pair display of the service request submittal. These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \n\nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \n\nThis handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base information to process. All data is passed into the handler as parameters. \n\nThe following data is used to create the 'WOI:WorkInfo' record: \n\n* Sets the 'Detailed Description' field to a concatenation of the following: \n\n  - The URL link to the Review Request view of the triggering Kinetic Request submission (if provided). \n\n  - The value of the \"Work Info Notes\" parameter. \n\n  - The formatted string of Question name to full answer pairs (if provided). \n\n* Sets the 'Work Order Entry ID' field to the result of a lookup to the WOI:WorkOrder form.  The lookup is done using the work order id parameter and the resulting entry's request id is used. \n\n* Attaches the files associated to the specified Attachment field menu label parameters to the specified fields: \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log01'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 1\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log02'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 2\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log03'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 3\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the specified values: \n\n  - 'z1D Previous Operation'   => \"SET\" \n\n  - 'Status'                   => \"Enabled\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n\n  - 'Work Order ID'\t\t       => \"Work Order ID\" \n\n  - 'Description'              => \"Work Info Summary\" \n\n  - 'Detailed Description'     => \"Work Info Notes\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Date'            => \"Work Info Submit Date\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Submitter'       => \"Submitter\" \n\n  - 'Secure Work Log'          => \"No\" \n\n  - 'View Access'              => \"Internal\" \n\n  - 'Communication Source'     => \"Web\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Type'            => \"General Information\" ",

The relationship is established by placing the Incident Number in the 'Incident Number' field on the 'HPD:Work Log' form. \n\nThe Include Review Request parameter invokes a method that builds and places a link in the Notes field on the Work Info entry.  When this link is clicked, the original service request submission is opened in the read-only Review Request mode. \n\nThe Include Question Answers parameter invokes a method which builds a question and answer pair display of the service request submittal. These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \n\nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \n\nThis handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base information to process. All data is passed into the handler as parameters. \n\nThis handler allows for a configuration where the ARS system used for Kinetic and the ARS system used for BMC Remedy ITSM7 are different. \n\nThe following data is used to create the 'HPD:Worklog' record: \n\n* Sets the 'Detailed Description' field to a concatenation of the following: \n\n  - The URL link to the Review Request view of the triggering Kinetic Request submission (if provided). \n\n  - The value of the \"Work Info Notes\" parameter. \n\n  - The formatted string of Question name to full answer pairs (if provided). \n\n* Sets the 'Incident Entry ID' field to the result of a lookup to the HPD:Help Desk form.  The lookup is done using the incident number parameter and the resulting entry's request id is used. \n\n* Attaches the files associated to the specified Attachment field menu label parameters to the specified fields: \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log01'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 1\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log02'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 2\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log03'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 3\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the specified values: \n\n  - 'Communication Source'     => \"Web\" \n\n  - 'z1D Previous Operation'   => \"SET\" \n\n  - 'Status'                   => \"Enabled\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Type'            => \"General Information\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n\n  - 'Incident Number'          => \"Incident Number\" \n\n  - 'Description'              => \"Work Info Summary\" \n\n  - 'Detailed Description'     => \"Work Info Notes\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Date'            => \"Work Info Submit Date\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Submitter'       => \"Submitter\" \n\n  - 'Secure Work Log'          => \"Locked\" \n\n  - 'View Access'              => \"View Access\" ",

The relationship is established by placing the Incident ID in the 'Incident ID' field on the 'WOI:WorkInfo' form. \n\nThe Include Review Request parameter invokes a method that builds and places a link in the Notes field on the Work Info entry.  When this link is clicked, the original service request submission is opened in the read-only Review Request mode. \n\nThe Include Question Answers parameter invokes a method which builds a question and answer pair display of the service request submittal. These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \n\nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \n\nThis handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base information to process. All data is passed into the handler as parameters. \n\nThis handler allows for a configuration where the ARS system used for Kinetic and the ARS system used for BMC Remedy ITSM7 are different. \n\nThe following data is used to create the 'WOI:WorkInfo' record: \n\n* Sets the 'Detailed Description' field to a concatenation of the following: \n\n  - The URL link to the Review Request view of the triggering Kinetic Request submission (if provided). \n\n  - The value of the \"Work Info Notes\" parameter. \n\n  - The formatted string of Question name to full answer pairs (if provided). \n\n* Sets the 'Incident Entry ID' field to the result of a lookup to the WOI:WorkOrder form.  The lookup is done using the Incident id parameter and the resulting entry's request id is used. \n\n* Attaches the files associated to the specified Attachment field menu label parameters to the specified fields: \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log01'          => \"Attachment Field 1\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log02'          => \"Attachment Field 2\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log03'          => \"Attachment Field 3\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the specified values: \n\n  - 'z1D Previous Operation'   => \"SET\" \n\n  - 'Status'                   => \"Enabled\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n\n  - 'Incident ID'\t\t       => \"Incident ID\" \n\n  - 'Description'              => \"Work Info Summary\" \n\n  - 'Detailed Description'     => \"Work Info Notes\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Date'            => \"Work Info Submit Date\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Submitter'       => \"Submitter\" \n\n  - 'Secure Work Log'          => \"No\" \n\n  - 'View Access'              => \"Internal\" \n\n  - 'Communication Source'     => \"Web\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Type'            => \"General Information\" ",

          "detailedDescription": "This handler uses the Google API library to unshare a Google Calendar that has been previously shared. The handler first uses the inputted refresh token and client id/secret to authorize the client (instructions on how to get these values can be found below). A call is then made to exchange the Calendar Name for a unique Calendar Id. Then another call will be made to Google to find the ACL Id of the calendar (the rule that says who the calendar can be shared to) so that it can then be deleted. Any errors that occur during the posting process will be caught and re-raised by this handler. \n\n* In order to use this handler, the account specified by the task info values needs to enable Calendar API in admin account. \n\n#### How to retrieve the Client Id, Client Secret, and Refresh Token\nTo enable the Calendar API and get Client Id and Client Secret: \n      1. Navigate to the 'Google Developers Console' \n      2. Click on the Create Project button (or if you have an existing project that you wish to keep using, click on the project name.) \n      3. Go to the APIs page and turn on the Calendar service \n      4. Go to the Credientials page and Create a new Client Id \n          * Select 'Installed Application' for the application type \n          * Select 'Other' for the Installed Application Type \nTo retrieve the Refresh Token for the account you want to post to \n      1. Put this url into your browser, while substiuting [:client_id] for the client id of your application \n      * https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=[:client_id]&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar&response_type=code&access_type=offline \n\n      2. Choose or add the account that you wish to connect the handler with \n      3. Click accept to give your application permission to modify the calendar \n      4. Copy and paste the success code that appears on the page \n      5. Send a post request to get the refresh token \n          * This can either done with Curl or with a browser extension like Advanced REST Client in Chrome (A sample curl call is below) \nPOST URL = https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token POST Parameters: code=[:code]&client_id=[:client_id]&client_secret=[:client_secret]&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&grant_type=authorization_code \nSample Curl Call: curl -- data \"code=[:code]&client_id=[:client_id]&client_secret=[:client_secret]&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&grant_type=authorization_code\" https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token ",

Before using this handler, a valid Service Account must be created/used and the Google Sheets API needs to be enabled (see below for details on how to do this). Using the contents of a Google Service Account JSON key to authenticate against Google's API, the handler takes a spreadsheet id, worksheet name, and row number and removes the values from all the columns in that row. (If you don't already have the spreadsheet id, it can be found in the URL when editing a spreadsheet in the browser - between the /d/ and /edit.) \nie. For the url - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xyao84fV2LyU1svyx48KTSbBgiq_mPr2w142bbZce8g/edit#gid=0 \n- the id is: 1xyao84fV2LyU1svyx48KTSbBgiq_mPr2w142bbZce8g \n\n\n#### service_account_key_json Info Value\nTo authenticate with Google, the handler uses the contents to the Service Account JSON key to authenticate against Google.

          "detailedDescription": "This handler leverages Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) technology to execute SQL queries against a database server.  JDBC provides an abstract inferface for querying against different database systems.  In order to configure a connection, a JDBC Driver must be made available, typically by including a .jar file somewhere on the classpath.  In order to initializing the JDBC connection, a JDBC driver, or adapter class, associated to the connection must be pre-loaded.  Once the JDBC adapter class is loaded, a simple connection string, which specifies the location of the server, name of the database to connect to and a list of parameters can be used to initialize a connection. \n\nPractically, this means that a JDBC .jar file specific to the target database server will need to be added to the Kinetic Task web application WEB-INF/lib directory.  Additionally, the adapter class and connection string info values will need to be configured specific to the JDBC adapter that is being used to connect.  Below are some example configurations for commonly used JDBC adapters. \n\nDB2 Adapter Class:     com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver Connection String: jdbc:db2://[SERVER][:PORT]/[DATABASE] \n\nMicrosoft SQL Server Adapter Class:     com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver Connection String: jdbc:sqlserver://[SERVER][:PORT];databaseName=[DATABASE] \n\nOracle Adapter Class:     oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver Connection String: jdbc:oracle:thin:@//[SERVER][:PORT]/[SERVICENAME] \n\nMySQL Adapter Class:     com.mysql.jdbc.Driver Connection String: jdbc:mysql://[SERVER][:PORT]/[DATABASE] \n\nOnce you have JDBC configured, you will also need to configure the handler to execute your specific query. In the node.xml file, insert your query in the <config name=\"query\"/> node, using curly braces for the parameters that you wish to be dynamic. Below is an example of a query were the username and name will be dynamic values. \n\nSELECT * FROM Users WHERE name={name} AND username={username} \n\nAny value that you used inside of the curly braces will now need to be added as a parameter. The parameter id must be the same as the value in the curly braces for the query to properly execute. Once all this is configured, the handler will now be able to retrieve a value for you from your desired database! \n\n\n\n\n#### Testing the Handler\nNOTE: Testing this handler requires the Kinetic Task 3.0 testing harness. \n\nIn order to test this handler, the JDBC .jar file must be made available to the java virtual machine.

This package includes a single Java class (for sample.helloworld.Greeter) that defines the static method \"greet\".  This method takes two java.util.LinkedHashMap parameters (one for the task handler info values and one for the passed parameters) and returns another java.util.LinkedHashMap. \n\nThe handler init.rb file defines the typical handler class (in this case SampleJavaHelloWorldV1) with an #initialize and #execute method.  The #initialize method builds up a java.util.LinkedHashMap for for the info values and parameters rather than a Ruby Hash so that they are easier to pass into the Java application.  The #execute method calls the desired Java class method, passing in the two java.util.LinkedHashMap objects, and then iterates over the returned java.util.LinkedHashMap object (representing a map of result names to values) to build up the typical XML result. \n\n\n#### Modifying This Handler\nTo modify this handler, the process/info.xml and process/node.xml files will need to be adjusted as normal (in order to define the handler node info configuration values, input parameters, and output results.  The only changes necessary to the handler/init.rb file are to change the class name and the Java code that is called (see below for the current Java code call). Java::sample.helloworld.Greeter.greet(@info_values, @parameters) \n\nThis particular handler includes the helloworld application as a .jar file included in the handler/lib directory.  Java applications that are compiled as jar files and included in the handler/lib directory need to be manually included in the handler/init.rb file (as helloworld.jar is for this sample package). This is only required for java libraries that have not already been loaded in the JVM classloader (usually by being placed somewhere on the classpath).  Any Java libraries or classes that were loaded by the JVM can be referenced without additional Ruby require statements. \n\nIf there are multiple handlers that are using the same library jar files, it is typically preferred to put those jar files somewhere on the JVM classpath (in the case of Tomcat, %WEBAPP_HOME%/WEB-INF/lib and omitting the manual include call in the handler/init.rb file.  Please remember that any changes to the jar file will require a restart of the JVM (or web application server) to be picked up. ",

          "description": "This is a sample handler that shows you how to delete a record from your  database using JDBC.",
          "detailedDescription": "This handler leverages Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) technology to execute SQL queries against a database server.  JDBC provides an abstract inferface for querying against different database systems.  In order to configure a connection, a JDBC Driver must be made available, typically by including a .jar file somewhere on the classpath.  In order to initializing the JDBC connection, a JDBC driver, or adapter class, associated to the connection must be pre-loaded.  Once the JDBC adapter class is loaded, a simple connection string, which specifies the location of the server, name of the database to connect to and a list of parameters can be used to initialize a connection. \n\nPractically, this means that a JDBC .jar file specific to the target database server will need to be added to the Kinetic Task web application WEB-INF/lib directory.  Additionally, the adapter class and connection string info values will need to be configured specific to the JDBC adapter that is being used to connect.  Below are some example configurations for commonly used JDBC adapters. \n\nDB2 Adapter Class:     com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver Connection String: jdbc:db2://[SERVER][:PORT]/[DATABASE] \n\nMicrosoft SQL Server Adapter Class:     com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver Connection String: jdbc:sqlserver://[SERVER][:PORT];databaseName=[DATABASE] \n\nOracle Adapter Class:     oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver Connection String: jdbc:oracle:thin:@//[SERVER][:PORT]/[SERVICENAME] \n\nMySQL Adapter Class:     com.mysql.jdbc.Driver Connection String: jdbc:mysql://[SERVER][:PORT]/[DATABASE] \n\nOnce you have JDBC configured, you will also need to configure the handler to execute your specific query. In the node.xml file, insert your query in the <config name=\"query\"/> node, using curly braces for the parameters that you wish to be dynamic. Below is an example of a query were the username and password will be dynamic values. \n\nDELETE FROM Users WHERE Id={id} \n\nAny value that you used inside of the curly braces will now need to be added as a parameter. The parameter id must be the same as the value in the curly braces. \n\nOnce all this is configured, the handler will now be able to delete a value for you from your desired database! An error will be thrown if your query returns more than one result. \n\n\n\n\n#### Testing the Handler\nNOTE: Testing this handler requires the Kinetic Task 3.0 testing harness. \n\nIn order to test this handler, the JDBC .jar file must be made available to the java virtual machine.  In order to do this, java must be called directly (rather than executing the kinetic task jar file using java -jar kinetic-task.jar ...).  See below for a sample execution (which assumes that the current working directory is the root of the handler): \n\njava -classpath [PATH]\\kinetic-task.jar;[PATH]\\[JDBC_JAR_FILE].jar com.kineticdata.task.Main -test-handler=. \n\nThe simple test case shows the configuration for executing this handler against a Kinetic Matrix instance, which uses an Oracle database.  Included in the test directory is a lib/ojdbc6.jar file, which is a JDBC jar file for Oracle (which requires Java 6 or higher).  If the test harness is being run from Java 6 and connecting to a Matrix instance, the following command line can be used to execute the test process: \n\njava -classpath [PATH]\\kinetic-task.jar;test\\lib\\ojdbc6.jar com.kineticdata.task.Main -test-handler=.

The handler uses the getRecords call from the Service Now SOAP API, so the parameter provided just needs to specify what to look for in incident fields.

For example, you could search for any incidents that were created after a certain time (ie. <__encoded_query>sys_created_on > 2014-04-15</__encoded_query>). For everything else, you can make the search with the xml tag beings the field that you want to search.
