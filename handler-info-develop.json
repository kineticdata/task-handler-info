The values that you specify in the revoke request (for example, ports) must match the existing rule's values for the rule to be removed. Each rule consists of the protocol and the CIDR range or source security group. For the TCP and UDP protocols, you must also specify the destination port or range of ports. For the ICMP protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code. Rule changes are propagated to instances within the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.  This handler implements a subset of the full AWS call (single rule submission only).  For more information see the AWS Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide online. \n\nThe Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the handler action.

When this link is clicked, the original service request submission is opened in the read-only Review Request mode. \n\nThe Include Question Answers parameter invokes a method which builds a question and answer pair display of the service request submittal. These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \n\nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \n\nThis handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base information to process.

Change Entry ID' field to the result of a lookup to the CHG:Infrastructure Change form.  The lookup is done using the change number parameter and the resulting entry's request id is used. \n\n* Attaches the files associated to the specified Attachment field menu label parameters to the specified fields: \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log01'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 1\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log02'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 2\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log03'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 3\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the specified values: \n\n  - 'Communication Source'     => \"Web\" \n\n  - 'z1D Previous Operation'   => \"SET\" \n\n  - 'Status'                   => \"Enabled\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Type'            => \"General Information\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n\n  - 'Infra.

These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \n\nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \n\nThis handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base information to process.

          "detailedDescription": "Creates Work Info entries related to an Incident.  The relationship is established by placing the Incident Number in the 'Incident Number' field on the 'HPD:Work Log' form. \n\nThe Include Review Request parameter invokes a method that builds and places a link in the Notes field on the Work Info entry.  When this link is clicked, the original service request submission is opened in the read-only Review Request mode. \n\nThe Include Question Answers parameter invokes a method which builds a question and answer pair display of the service request submittal. These data elements are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick view of the triggering service request submittal data. \n\nThe Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question. The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries. \n\nThis handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base information to process. All data is passed into the handler as parameters. \n\n\n\nThe following data is used to create the 'HPD:Worklog' record: \n\n* Sets the 'Detailed Description' field to a concatenation of the following: \n\n  - The URL link to the Review Request view of the triggering Kinetic Request submission (if provided). \n\n  - The value of the \"Work Info Notes\" parameter. \n\n  - The formatted string of Question name to full answer pairs (if provided). \n\n* Sets the 'Incident Entry ID' field to the result of a lookup to the HPD:Help Desk form.  The lookup is done using the incident number parameter and the resulting entry's request id is used. \n\n* Attaches the files associated to the specified Attachment field menu label parameters to the specified fields: \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log01'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 1\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log02'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 2\" \n\n  - 'z2AF Work Log03'          => \"Attachment Question Menu Label 3\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the specified values: \n\n  - 'Communication Source'     => \"Web\" \n\n  - 'z1D Previous Operation'   => \"SET\" \n\n  - 'Status'                   => \"Enabled\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Type'            => \"General Information\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n\n  - 'Incident Number'          => \"Incident Number\" \n\n  - 'Description'              => \"Work Info Summary\" \n\n  - 'Detailed Description'     => \"Work Info Notes\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Date'            => \"Work Info Submit Date\" \n\n  - 'Work Log Submitter'       => \"Submitter\" \n\n  - 'Secure Work Log'          => \"Locked\" \n\n  - 'View Access'              => \"View Access\" ",

This causes Remedy workflow to map values from the template into the CHG:Infrastructure Change (Changes) form. \n\nAdditional information about the usage of Infrastructure Change Templates can be found in the BMC Remedy ITSM Configurations guide. \n\nThe following data is used to create the 'CHG:ChangeInterface_Create' record: \n\n* Sets the 'TemplateID' field to the Instance Id of the Change template that was specified in the \"Change Template Name\" parameter. \n\n* Maps the deferral token of the task instance generated by this handler into the 'SRMSAOIGuid' field. \n\n\n\n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n\n  - 'First Name'            => \"Requester First Name\" \n\n  - 'Last Name'             => \"Requester Last Name\" \n\n  - 'Customer Internet E-mail' => \"Requester Email\" \n\n  - 'Company'               => \"Requester Support Company\" \n\n  - 'Submitter'             => \"Submitter Login Id\" \n\n  - 'Company3'              => \"Change Manager Support Company\" \n\n  - 'Support Organization'  => \"Change Manager Support Organization\" \n\n  - 'Support Group Name'    => \"Change Manager Support Group Name\" \n\n  - 'SRID'                  => 'CustomerSurveyID' (the KSR number) \n\n  - 'SRInstanceID'          => 'CustomerSurveyInstanceId' (the Instance Id).

The updated node object is then re-posted to the Chef Server to apply the changes to the node attributes on the Chef Server. And errors that are encountered during the process are caught and re-rasied by the handler. ",

          "detailedDescription": "This handler bootstraps a node in chef by using an external ruby instance to call chef. Before uploading this handler, make sure to include a chef repository containing a knife.rb file either in the resources directory of the handler file or somewhere else on the task engine server. Once the handler starts running, it begins by error checking the parameters based on what type of server the task engine is running on (windows or unix). \n\nOn Windows machine the process consists of: \n\n- Loading and accepting the EULA for PsExec.exe (which will be used to run knife as a background process) \n\nOn both Unix and Windows machines the process consists of: \n\n- Checking if a knife.rb file is accessible from the handler \n\n- Checking if ruby with the json gem are installed (json is automatically included in ruby 1.9 and later) \n\n- Checking if the task location provided in the info values contains a source with the name provided in the parameters \n\nIf none of these situations throw an error, the handler then moves onto calling a script that handles the actual knife bootstrap call. This script is passed a json string of all the parameters provided to the handler. After creating a file within the handler resources folder that will contain all of the logging information for the bootstrap call (each call will have a different file, with the form of bootstrap_run_[epoch timestamp].log). The actual knife call that will be made follows the form of: \n\nknife bootstrap [server name] -x [user config] -N \"[node name]\" -r \"[recipe]\" -c [knife.rb location] \n\nThe bootstrapping process can take a long time, so once the script is started, the handler ends and is put into a deferred state until the bootstrap command is complete. Once that finishes, the script sends the deferral token back to the task tree using the Kinetic Task API and net/http (example POST that the script uses is below). Once the deferral token is recieved, the handler completes its process. \n\nTask 3 Deferral Callback \n\nPOST [task_location]/rest/v1/Trigger/createDeferred action=Complete&token=[deferral token] \n\nTask 4 Deferral Callback \n\nPOST [task_location]/app/api/v1/complete-deferred-task/[source name] { \"token\" : [deferral token] } \n\n\n#### Info Values\nTwo info values need to be provided with Chef Node Bootstrap. [Knife Location] The path to the knife.rb file on the server. If an absolute path is not given, the handler assumes the file was placed in the resources directory. \n\nie. chef-repo/.chef/knife.rb means that the file is located at chef_node_bootstrap_v1/handler/resources/chef-repo/.chef/knife.rb [Task Location] The url where your task instance is located \n\nie. http://127.0.0.1:8080/kinetic-task \n\n\n#### Knife Configuration\nInformation on how to configure knife on your machine can be found at -- http://docs.getchef.com/chef/knife.html ",

Create an app in the Dropbox App Console (if you already have an app, you can skip to step #5) \n\n\n    2. First, go to the Dropbox Developers page and go to the App Console \n\n\n    3. Click the 'Create app' button and choose the following options \n        - Dropbox API app \n        - File and datastores \n        - No - My app needs access to files already on Dropbox \n        - All file types - My app needs access to a user's full Dropbox. Only supported via the Core API. \n        - Input an App Name \n\n\n    4. Click in to see the details of the app you just created and add 'http://localhost' to the OAuth redirect URIs \n\n\n    5. To easily retrieve the access token, unzip the handler file and navigate to the resources folder (handler -> resources) and open retrieveAccessToken.html \n\n\n    6. Follow the instructions on that page to generate your access token. Insert it into your info values and you are now properly authenticated with Dropbox! ",

Before using this handler, a valid Service Account must be created/used and the Google Sheets API needs to be enabled (see below for details on how to do this). Using the contents of a Google Service Account JSON key to authenticate against Google's API, the handler takes the inputted name and creates a new spreadsheet with this name. \n\n\n\n\n#### service_account_key_json Info Value\nTo authenticate with Google, the handler uses the contents to the Service Account JSON key to authenticate against Google. When the handler has been uploaded to Kinetic Task, open up the JSON key that was downloaded from Google (instructions below if needed) and copy the contents of it into the service_account_key_json info value (copy everything, including the beginning and ending JSON braces {}). \n\n\n#### Creating a Service Account\n\n  1. Navigate to the 'Google Developers Console' \n    - Located at https://console.developers.google.com \n    - If the URL has changed, try googling 'Google API Developer Console' to either find the console or find Google's current documentation for how to create an API project \n  2.

Create a new Credential of the type 'Service Account' \n    - When creating the Service Account, choose a 'Key type' of JSON \n  5. Make note of where the JSON key was downloaded on creation. It will be needed for authentication later. \n\n\n#### Enabling the Google Sheets API\n\n  1. In the Google Developers Console, navigate to the Library section \n  2. Find the Google Sheets API and click on the link \n  3. Find 'Enable' at the top of the page and click it to enable the API \n\n\n#### Allowing an Impersonated User to Authenticate with the Service Account\nNOTE: To allow an impersonated user to authenticate with a service account, a process called 'Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority' must be enacted by a Google Apps account admin to allow a Service Account to impersonate users. \n\n  1. Go to your Google Apps domain’s Admin console. \n\n  2. Go to the 'Security' page. \n\n  3. Select 'Advanced settings' from the list of options. If it isn't on the page originally, click 'Show More' at the bottom of the page. \n\n  4. Select 'Manage API client access' in the Authentication section. \n\n  5.

After all the submissions that match the query have been returned, the handler formats it into one of three possible output formats: a JSON string, an XML string, or an XML list of submission ids. \n\nIf ID List is selected as the Return Type, the output looks like: \n\n<ids><id>f4cd6acf-e552-11e5-9c32-97bbc6bf7f84</id><id>bbc6bf7f-...</id></ids> \n\nNote: The limit by default for submissions in 25, so if you want to retrieve more submissions than that add a limit=n (where n is an integer representing the new limit) to the query string ",

One result is the row count of the rows of data saved. The other is the instance IDs of the record for each row. This allows for looping through the rows without having to do a find handler if you want to loop through every row in the table. \n\nThe format of the XML of request IDs returned is: \n\n<request_ids> <request_id>000000000000001</request_id> <request_id>000000000000002</request_id> </request_ids> \n\nThe format of the XML of instance IDs returned is: \n\n<instance_ids> <instance_id>AG00505696001CJTK_UQ8h_IBgSCAE</instance_id> <instance_id>AG00505696001CJjK_UQ5CDIBgSyAE</instance_id> </instance_ids> \n\nThis handler can be used to store data for reporting. The Associated Request GUID (Originating ID) is a required field, but the Template Name and Instance ID are not. Note that this data may be required by your reporting process if you want to report on data by template, rather than just by individual record. ",

If that doesn't return data it raises an exception. \n\nThe following data is used to create the KS_SAMPLE_Incident record: \n\n* Maps the deferral token of the task instance generated by this handler into the 'Link Id' field. \n\n* Sets the following field values to the specified values: \n\n  - 'Case Type'                => \"Incident\" \n\n  - 'Status'                   => \"New\" \n\n  - 'Priority'                 => \"Low\" \n\n* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters: \n\n  - 'AR Login'                 => \"Login ID\" \n\n  - 'Summary'                  => \"Summary\" \n\n  - 'Description'              => \"Description\" \n\n* Sets the following KS_SAMPLE_Incident field values to the specified field values of the retrieved KS_SAMPLE_People record: \n\n  - 'AR Login' \n\n  - 'First Name' \n\n  - 'Last Name' \n\n  - 'Full Name' \n\n  - 'Phone Number' \n\n  - 'Email' \n\n  - 'Region' \n\n  - 'Site' \n\n  - 'Department' \n\n  - 'Office' \n\n  - 'Company' ",

          "detailedDescription": "This handler makes a SOAP call (using Savon) to the SharePoint Web Services to create a new task in your sites 'Task' list. After configuring Savon to work with the given account credentials, a few inputted values are checked for validity while the parameters for 'Assigned To' and 'Priority' are modified to fit SharePoint standard. Next, the Batch XML structure is built to give the Web Service the information it needs to create the new task, which is then passed via a SOAP call to SharePoint, where the task is created. Any errors that occur during this process will be caught and re-raised by the handler. Authentication is done through SSL, so the SharePoint site being accessed needs to be setup to allow SSL connections. \n\n\n\n* Make sure the SharePoint Web Services database is turned on. \n\n\n#### How to Obtain the Homepage URL Info Value\nTo find the homepage url, all you have to do is look at the URL of any page on the SharePoint site. The url that should be inputted should contain both the base url (the top-most site in the collection) and the sub-site that you are on. For example, given the following URL: https://sharepoint.company.com/development/SitePages/Home.aspx The base site is \"sharepoint.company.com\", the sub-site is \"development\" and the 'HomePage URL' task info values should be set to: https://sharepoint.company.com/development \n\n",

JDBC provides an abstract inferface for querying against different database systems.  In order to configure a connection, a JDBC Driver must be made available, typically by including a .jar file somewhere on the classpath.  In order to initializing the JDBC connection, a JDBC driver, or adapter class, associated to the connection must be pre-loaded.  Once the JDBC adapter class is loaded, a simple connection string, which specifies the location of the server, name of the database to connect to and a list of parameters can be used to initialize a connection. \n\nPractically, this means that a JDBC .jar file specific to the target database server will need to be added to the Kinetic Task web application WEB-INF/lib directory.

          "detailedDescription": "This handler package includes a lib/helloworld.jar package.  This package includes a single Java class (for sample.helloworld.Greeter) that defines the static method \"greet\".  This method takes two java.util.LinkedHashMap parameters (one for the task handler info values and one for the passed parameters) and returns another java.util.LinkedHashMap. \n\nThe handler init.rb file defines the typical handler class (in this case SampleJavaHelloWorldV1) with an #initialize and #execute method.  The #initialize method builds up a java.util.LinkedHashMap for for the info values and parameters rather than a Ruby Hash so that they are easier to pass into the Java application.  The #execute method calls the desired Java class method, passing in the two java.util.LinkedHashMap objects, and then iterates over the returned java.util.LinkedHashMap object (representing a map of result names to values) to build up the typical XML result. \n\n\n#### Modifying This Handler\nTo modify this handler, the process/info.xml and process/node.xml files will need to be adjusted as normal (in order to define the handler node info configuration values, input parameters, and output results.  The only changes necessary to the handler/init.rb file are to change the class name and the Java code that is called (see below for the current Java code call). Java::sample.helloworld.Greeter.greet(@info_values, @parameters) \n\nThis particular handler includes the helloworld application as a .jar file included in the handler/lib directory.  Java applications that are compiled as jar files and included in the handler/lib directory need to be manually included in the handler/init.rb file (as helloworld.jar is for this sample package). This is only required for java libraries that have not already been loaded in the JVM classloader (usually by being placed somewhere on the classpath).  Any Java libraries or classes that were loaded by the JVM can be referenced without additional Ruby require statements. \n\nIf there are multiple handlers that are using the same library jar files, it is typically preferred to put those jar files somewhere on the JVM classpath (in the case of Tomcat, %WEBAPP_HOME%/WEB-INF/lib and omitting the manual include call in the handler/init.rb file.  Please remember that any changes to the jar file will require a restart of the JVM (or web application server) to be picked up. ",

The return json uses the sys_id as the key and the value is another JSON map with all the information about the incident. To query for an incident, you need to provide the query in xml. The handler uses the getRecords call from the Service Now SOAP API, so the parameter provided just needs to specify what to look for in incident fields. For example, if you are searching for a date (or anything that can't be qualified by a direct equality statement), you can use the <__encoded_query> parameter, which can be used for any general query statements. For example, you could search for any incidents that were created after a certain time (ie. <__encoded_query>sys_created_on > 2014-04-15</__encoded_query>). For everything else, you can make the search with the xml tag beings the field that you want to search. For example, if you want to match a incident number or short description, you would search for <number>INC000000001</number> or <short_description>this is a short description</short_description>. ",

If the inputted access token belongs to a verified admin in a paid Yammer network, external email domains can be included. If not, only email addresses for official company domains will be allowed.  Any errors that happen during this process will be caught and re-raised by the handler. \n\nNote: This handler requires a verified admin account in a paid Yammer network! (If you are an admin and still getting an error with the message \"Attempt to access a protected resource failed\" make sure that you are also verified.) \n\n\n#### How to retrieve your Access Token\n\n* These instructions can also be found on developer.yammer.com/authentication under client-side authentication \n  1. Start by creating a client application at https://www.yammer.com/client_applications \n  2. Fill in the required information and create the application \n  3. Using the client id you retrieved from the application, paste this url into your browser, making sure to replace [:client_id]: \n     - https://www.yammer.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=[:client_id]&redirect_uri=127.0.0.1&response_type=token \n  4. After submitting that page and authorizing the application, look in the url to find your access token. That url will look like: \n     - https://www.yammer.com127.0.0.1/#access_token=[:access_token] \n  5. Paste this Access Token into your info values and you will be all set! \n\nIf you have already registered Kinetic Task with your Yammer network, or if you receive a message stating that the \"Application Name is already in use\", you can view your list of registered applications at: https://www.yammer.com/client_applications Click on your application details to get your client id and client secret.
